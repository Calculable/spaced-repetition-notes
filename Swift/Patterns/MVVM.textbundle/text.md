##  Unterschied zu MVC

> In MVC the way most Apple developers practice it, the view controller forms part of the Controller layer (the C in MVC), which means it’s responsible for doing lots of layout as well as being a general dumping ground for functionality.

> In MVVM view controllers are considered part of the V layer, which means their job is to focus specifically on layout and the view lifecycle – `viewDidLoad()` and so on
