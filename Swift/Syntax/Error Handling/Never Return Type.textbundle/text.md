# Never Return Type
ðŸ§¨

## Â Zweck
The `Never` return type is a special one in Swift, and tells the compiler that execution will never return when this function is called.

Itâ€™s used by Swiftâ€™s `fatalError()` and `preconditionFailure()` functions, both of which cause your app to crash if they are called.

The  `Never`  return type is useful because it lets Swift waive other requirements. For example, if youâ€™re in a function that must return a value, calling a  `Never`  function means you donâ€™t need to return anything â€“ Swift knows you canâ€™t return a value any more.
