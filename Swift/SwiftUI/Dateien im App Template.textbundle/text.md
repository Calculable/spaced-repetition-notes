1.  **YourProjectName.swift**. This performs an initial set up, then creates and displays your initial view.
2.  **ContentView.swift**. This is our initial piece of user interface. If this were a UIKit project, this would be the  `ViewController`  class that Xcode gave us.
3.  **Assets.xcassets**. This is an asset catalog, which stores all the images and colors used in our project.
4.  **Info.plist** is a property list file, which in this instance is used to store system-wide settings for our app â€“ what name should be shown below its icon on the iOS home screen, for example.
5.  A group called **Preview Content**, which contains another asset catalog called Preview Assets.
