# intrinsic content size festlegen für SwiftUI View
↕️

```swift
.frame(idealWidth: 40, idealHeight: 40)
```

> If you don't provide a specific width and height for your view, SwiftUI will use the `idealWidth` and `idealHeight` as a guide to determine the size of your view. However, the actual size of the view can still be influenced by its content, its container, and other constraints in the layout. The `idealWidth` and `idealHeight` are just suggestions for the size, not strict values.
